		<h1 class="Titre1">Xceed&nbsp;Words&nbsp;for .NET
		</h1>
		<h2 class="Titre2">Introduction</h2>
		<P class="Txt">With its easy to use API, Xceed Words for .NET lets your application create new Microsoft Word .docx documents, or modify existing ones. It gives you complete control over all content in a Word document, and lets you add or remove all commonly used element types, such as paragraphs, bulleted or numbered lists, images, tables, charts, headers and footers, sections, bookmarks, and more.</P>
        <P class="Txt">
			The product is available through a subscription that delivers much more than 
            just a perpetual license for versions received during the subscription. You also 
            get a year of these great services: expert priority support and access to new 
            versions, new features, and bug fixes. A Blueprint subscription adds 
            C# source code.</P>
        <P class="Txt">
			All Xceed products can be tried out with a fully functional 45-day trial and 
            come with a 60-day money-back guarantee after purchase.</P>
			<h2 class="Titre2">Installing</h2>
		<P class="Txt">
			The installer copies all the library's files to the appropriate locations, but 
			you still need to take additional steps to make the component available from 
			your particular development environment. To do this, please consult the 
			"Installation instructions" topic in the documentation file and follow all the 
			steps.</P>
		<h2 class="Titre2">Licensing</h2>
		<P class="Txt">Xceed’s .NET components can be used without a license key for a 
			45-day trial period. During this time, the components are fully functional. 
			Once the trial period has ended, a registered license key is needed to continue using 
			them. If you attempt to use a component after the trial period without a 
			registered license key, an exception will be thrown and you will not be able to 
			use it.
		</P>
		<P class="Txt">If you have purchased a registered license key, assigning it to the 
			LicenseKey property will remove the trial limitations. The LicenseKey property 
			must be set with a valid license key, before any other method of your Xceed 
			component is called. If you use an invalid or expired license key, fail to 
			license the control with a registered license key after the trial period, or 
			license it in the wrong place in your code, an exception will be thrown at 
			runtime.
		</P>
		<P class="Txt">If, during the trial period, you wish to test your application on 
			another computer, please email support@xceed.com to obtain a trial key, then assign it to the LicenseKey property 
			as mentioned above.
		</P>
		<P class="Txt">
			For more information on how the 45-day trial works or how to license the 
			component once you purchase, refer to the&nbsp;Installation 
			Instructions&nbsp;topic in the documentation.
			<h2 class="Titre2">Distributing</h2>
		<P class="Txt">Both signed and unsigned versions of Xceed’s .NET assemblies are 
			available. Either version can be distributed, but please remember that signed 
			software of any kind can sometimes cause problems because the .NET Framework or 
			the operating system must contact an authentication server, which can in turn 
			trigger firewall alerts, etc.</P>
		<h2 class="Titre2">System Requirements</h2>
		<P class="Txt"><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>This product is compatible with .NET Framework 4.X and up and Visual Studio 2010 and up.</SPAN></SPAN>
		</P>
		<P class="Txt">
			Xceed Words for .NET&nbsp;is CLS (Common Language 
			Specification) compliant, so it should work with all .NET programming 
			languages, though Xceed's testing is limited to VB.NET and C#.</P>
